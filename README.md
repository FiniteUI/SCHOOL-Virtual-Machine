# Virtual-Machine, Spring 2017
This is the final project for my Spring 2017 Computer Architecture class. It is a simple virtual stack machine written in Java with an instruction set specified by the professor.

Full details for the assignment are available in VirtualMachineAssignment.pdf

The VM reads in a binary file and runs accordingly.

The instruction set is the same as used for the Assembler and Compiler I made in my Compiler Theory class, available in seperate repositories, so I would write a small program, run it through my compiler, run the output of that through my assembler, and run the output of that through this virtual machine to test all three of them.
